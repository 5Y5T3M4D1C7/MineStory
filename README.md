either by private message or a comment on the mod page. 
Thank you for your support and happy mining!

I own rights to the mod itself but don't own any rights for the textures used inside the mod, as most are directly from MapleStory with minor edits.
Modpack makers are free to use this in your modpack without asking for our permission but you must place a link to this page in the description of your modpack clearly and directly.
